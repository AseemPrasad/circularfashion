# Contribution Guidelines for circularfashion

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the circularfashion project! Your help is vital to building a sustainable resource.

We welcome contributions from everyone, especially during Hacktoberfest!

## Ways to Contribute (No Code Necessary!)

We encourage contributions in the following areas:

1.  **Documentation:** Improving the `README.md`, adding tutorials, or clarifying guides.
2.  **Content/Data:** Adding curated resource links, ethical fashion data, or case studies.
3.  **Code Quality:** Adding tests, refactoring code for readability, or fixing small issues.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to make your contribution:

1.  **Fork** the repository (if you are contributing externally).
2.  **Clone** the repository to your local machine.
3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-contribution-name`
4.  **Make your changes** using your preferred editor (like VS Code).
5.  **Commit** your changes with a clear message (e.g., `docs: Improve setup instructions`).

## Submitting Your Work

1.  **Push** your branch to your remote repository.
2.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub, targeting the `main` branch.
3.  **Wait for Approval:** As the maintainer, I will review the PR. For Hacktoberfest, I will either **merge** it or apply the **`hacktoberfest-accepted`** label to ensure it counts.

*We look forward to your contribution!*
